      a. Personal Information: Our goal is to help you understand what Personal Information (as defined below) is collected and how such information will be used before you decide whether to disclose it. Personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") means individually identifiable information about a User, including without limitation the User's full name, company name, title, user name and password, e mail address, telephone number and street address. Personal Information does not include information in a form that is aggregated with other information so as not to be reasonably identifiable as the User, and information in a form that otherwise is detached, combined, organized, segmented, modified or processed so as not to be reasonably capable of being associated with the User ("Nonpersonal Information"). As a result, Nonpersonal Information is not restricted by this Privacy Policy as to use, sharing or otherwise.

In addition, for security reasons there may be features on our Site that require you to confirm your Personal Information or provide additional Personal Information. You may choose not to provide us with Personal Information, but as a consequence you may not be able to use the Site, or take advantage of certain features of our Site, and we may not be able to provide you with certain requested information, products and/or services.

        Terms of Sale
      </b>
       All quotations and sales by MORSCO, Inc. and/or any present or future parent, subsidiary, affiliate or business unit of MORSCO, Inc. (collectively, “Seller”) to the Applicant, Guarantor(s) and/or any parent, subsidiary, affiliate or business unit of the Applicant (collectively, “Buyer”) are expressly conditioned upon Buyer's acceptance of these Terms and Conditions of Sale (the “Terms”). These Terms, along with any terms and conditions identified in Seller's quotation, invoice or delivery ticket for specific goods, which are incorporated by reference herein, reflect the complete agreement of Buyer and Seller with regard to the sale of goods by Seller to Buyer, and all prior proposals, agreements and understandings, oral or written, are superseded by these Terms. Modification or alteration of these Terms must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Buyer and Seller. Buyer's acceptance or receipt of the goods shall be deemed acceptance by Buyer of these Terms. Seller objects to additional or different terms and conditions in any Buyer purchase order, documentation or correspondence and those additional or different terms are of no force or effect.

        Delivery of Goods
      </b>
       The goods shall be delivered to Buyer in the manner specified in the purchase order. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver the goods to Buyer at the location date and time specified mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller and specified in writing. Partial deliveries of goods are permitted at Seller's discretion. Seller does not guarantee planned delivery dates, but will use reasonable efforts to meet them. Delivery of materials to the construction site constitutes delivery to Buyer regardless of whether Buyer or its agent is on site at the time of delivery. Seller will not be liable for failure or delay in delivery for any reason, and Buyer hereby waives any claims for damages arising therefrom.

        Title and Risk of Loss
      </b>
       Seller's responsibility for the goods sold under these Terms ceases upon its issuance of Bill of Lading or upon delivery of goods to Buyer or a common carrier or upon installation, whichever occurs first. Seller shall not be liable to Buyer for goods that are damaged or lost while in the possession of a common carrier, and Buyer is solely responsible for recovering any and all damage directly from the common carrier. Title to the goods passes to Buyer upon Seller's receipt of full payment from Buyer for all amounts owed for the goods. Buyer hereby grants Seller a security interest in the goods sold by Seller to Buyer under these Terms and any proceeds thereof as security for Buyer's obligation to Seller to pay the purchase price. This security interest shall commence upon the first delivery of goods to Buyer or upon installation, whichever occurs first, and shall terminate upon Buyer's full payment of all amounts due Seller. Buyer authorizes Seller to file financing statements or other documents in Seller's sole discretion to perfect this security interest along with other notices, and will assist Seller in taking any other action that Seller deems necessary in its sole discretion to perfect and protect Seller's security interest.

        Prices
      </b>
       Quoted prices are subject to change without notice, and all quotations expire and become invalid if Buyer does not accept them within 30 days from the date of issue. Price extensions when granted by Seller are for Buyer's convenience only, and they, as well as any mathematical, stenographic or clerical errors, are not binding on Seller. Any claims by Buyer related to billing errors or adjustments shall be made in writing to Seller within ten (10) days from the invoice date or they are waived by Buyer. Any changes by Buyer in quantities, destination, schedule or installation may result in a price adjustment by Seller. Prices shown do not include any sales, excise, or other governmental tax or charge payable by Seller to Federal, State, or local authority. Any taxes now or later imposed upon sales will be added to the purchase price. Buyer will reimburse Seller for any such tax or provide Seller with an acceptable tax exemption certificate. Prices quoted with respect to a particular purchase of goods or installation of the goods, and any applicable transportation charges, shall apply only to that particular order of goods and/or installation and not subsequent orders and purchases.

        Payment
      </b>
       Buyer shall pay Seller in full for all goods within thirty (30) days of the date Buyer takes receipt of the goods unless stated otherwise on the invoice. Payment shall be in the form of cash, check or wire transfer. Retainage shall not apply, and Buyer shall not hold back any retainage from Seller, even if retainage is part of any contract between Buyer and any other party. Payment is not contingent on Buyer's ability to collect or obtain funds from any other party. Buyer consents to Seller's presentment of and request for payment of any check or other payment order issued to Seller by Buyer by any commercially reasonable electronic means in accordance with applicable provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, and Buyer further authorizes any bank or other financial institution on which any such order is drawn or through which such order is payable to make payment pursuant to such order directly to Seller or for credit to Seller's account by electronic funds transfer. If Buyer fails to make any payment to Seller when due, Buyer's entire account(s) with Seller shall become immediately due and payable and Seller may suspend further performance under any order with Buyer. Seller may repossess and remove any materials sold to Buyer where payment is outstanding, without notice or demand. Notwithstanding anything stated therein to the contrary, any lien waiver or release executed by Seller related to the goods sold under these Terms shall only be effective to the extent payment is received, paid by the drawee bank, and not avoidable as a bankruptcy preference. Seller may apply Buyer's payment against any open charges within Seller's sole discretion. Seller may exercise setoff or recoupment to apply to or satisfy Buyer's outstanding debt. Buyer shall have no right of setoff hereunder, the same being expressly waived hereby. Buyer agrees to pay Seller on past due accounts a monthly interest charge equal to the maximum interest charge permitted to be charged by the law governing the account between Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller further agree that, where required by law to specify such rate, a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month shall apply. The interest shall continue to accrue after Seller receives a judgment against Buyer at the highest rate allowable by law then in effect. At no time will interest be charged at a rate higher than the maximum rate allowable by law in the State where suit is brought. Buyer agrees to pay Seller all costs and expenses of collection, suit, arbitration or other legal action, including all actual attorneys and paralegal fees, incurred pre-suit, through trial, on appeal, or in any administrative proceedings, mediations or arbitrations brought as a result of the commercial relationship between them. In any jurisdiction where a stated rate is required, reasonable attorney's fees shall be 15% of the outstanding balance.

        Trust

       Buyer agrees that all funds owed to or received by Buyer from any source, resulting from the labor or material supplied by Seller shall be held in trust for the benefit of Seller. Buyer agrees to promptly pay to Seller all such funds. Upon request, Buyer shall irrevocably assign to Seller its account receivable from anyone to the extent that such is resulting from the labor or materials supplied by Seller.

        Credit Terms
      </b>
       Issuance of any credit by Seller to Buyer shall be subject to the approval of Seller's credit department in its sole discretion. If Seller determines in its sole discretion that Buyer's financial responsibility is unsatisfactory, or becomes impaired, or if Buyer fails to make any payment for any goods purchased from seller when due, then Seller may postpone or decline to make any shipments except upon receipt of satisfactory security or payment of cash in advance of shipment, or Seller may cancel any or all contracts with Buyer or any portion thereof. If Buyer fails to comply with these Terms, or Buyer's credit becomes unsatisfactory in Seller's sole discretion, Seller reserves the right to terminate or restrict Seller's credit on any order upon notice to Buyer. Buyer certifies that it is solvent and that it will immediately advise Seller if it becomes insolvent. Buyer agrees to send Seller written notice of any changes in the form of ownership of Buyer's business within five days of such changes.

        Unavoidable Forces

       Seller shall not be liable for delay, damage or default in delivery resulting from any cause beyond Seller's reasonable control ("Unavoidable Forces"), including but not limited to, governmental action, terrorism, strikes, or other labor troubles, fire, damage of destruction of goods, manufacturer's shortages, damage of goods by shipping agents or carriers, inability to obtain materials, fuels, or supplies, weather events, floods or other so-called acts of God, or any other event interfering with the production, supply, transportation, or consumption of the goods being sold, or with the supply or consumption of any raw materials or labor used in connection with the goods. Upon occurrence of an Unavoidable Force, the time for Seller's performance shall be extended reasonably, the purchase price shall be adjusted for any increased costs to Seller resulting therefrom, and Buyer shall not be entitled to any other remedy.
