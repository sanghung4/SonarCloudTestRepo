          <b>Terms of Sale</b> All quotations and sales by MORSCO, Inc. and/or
          any present or future parent, subsidiary, affiliate or business unit
          of MORSCO, Inc. (collectively, “Seller”) to the Applicant,
          Guarantor(s) and/or any parent, subsidiary, affiliate or business unit
          of the Applicant (collectively, “Buyer”) are expressly conditioned
          upon Buyer's acceptance of these Terms and Conditions of Sale (the
          “Terms”). These Terms, along with any terms and conditions identified
          in Seller's quotation, invoice or delivery ticket for specific goods,
          which are incorporated by reference herein, reflect the complete
          agreement of Buyer and Seller with regard to the sale of goods by
          Seller to Buyer, and all prior proposals, agreements and
          understandings, oral or written, are superseded by these Terms.
          Modification or alteration of these Terms must be in writing and
          signed by an authorized representative of Buyer and Seller. Buyer's
          acceptance or receipt of the goods shall be deemed acceptance by Buyer
          of these Terms. Seller objects to additional or different terms and
          conditions in any Buyer purchase order, documentation or
          correspondence and those additional or different terms are of no force
          or effect.

          <b>Delivery of Goods</b> The goods shall be delivered to Buyer in the
          manner specified in the purchase order. Seller shall use reasonable
          efforts to deliver the goods to Buyer at the location date and time
          specified mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller and specified in
          writing. Partial deliveries of goods are permitted at Seller's
          discretion. Seller does not guarantee planned delivery dates, but will
          use reasonable efforts to meet them. Delivery of materials to the
          construction site constitutes delivery to Buyer regardless of whether
          Buyer or its agent is on site at the time of delivery. Seller will not
          be liable for failure or delay in delivery for any reason, and Buyer
          hereby waives any claims for damages arising therefrom.

          <b>Title and Risk of Loss</b> Seller's responsibility for the goods
          sold under these Terms ceases upon its issuance of Bill of Lading or
          upon delivery of goods to Buyer or a common carrier or upon
          installation, whichever occurs first. Seller shall not be liable to
          Buyer for goods that are damaged or lost while in the possession of a
          common carrier, and Buyer is solely responsible for recovering any and
          all damage directly from the common carrier. Title to the goods passes
          to Buyer upon Seller's receipt of full payment from Buyer for all
          amounts owed for the goods. Buyer hereby grants Seller a security
          interest in the goods sold by Seller to Buyer under these Terms and
          any proceeds thereof as security for Buyer's obligation to Seller to
          pay the purchase price. This security interest shall commence upon the
          first delivery of goods to Buyer or upon installation, whichever
          occurs first, and shall terminate upon Buyer's full payment of all
          amounts due Seller. Buyer authorizes Seller to file financing
          statements or other documents in Seller's sole discretion to perfect
          this security interest along with other notices, and will assist
          Seller in taking any other action that Seller deems necessary in its
          sole discretion to perfect and protect Seller's security interest.

          <b>Prices</b> Quoted prices are subject to change without notice, and
          all quotations expire and become invalid if Buyer does not accept them
          within 30 days from the date of issue. Price extensions when granted
          by Seller are for Buyer's convenience only, and they, as well as any
          mathematical, stenographic or clerical errors, are not binding on
          Seller. Any claims by Buyer related to billing errors or adjustments
          shall be made in writing to Seller within ten (10) days from the
          invoice date or they are waived by Buyer. Any changes by Buyer in
          quantities, destination, schedule or installation may result in a
          price adjustment by Seller. Prices shown do not include any sales,
          excise, or other governmental tax or charge payable by Seller to
          Federal, State, or local authority. Any taxes now or later imposed
          upon sales will be added to the purchase price. Buyer will reimburse
          Seller for any such tax or provide Seller with an acceptable tax
          exemption certificate. Prices quoted with respect to a particular
          purchase of goods or installation of the goods, and any applicable
          transportation charges, shall apply only to that particular order of
          goods and/or installation and not subsequent orders and purchases.

          <b>Payment</b> Buyer shall pay Seller in full for all goods within
          thirty (30) days of the date Buyer takes receipt of the goods unless
          stated otherwise on the invoice. Payment shall be in the form of cash,
          check or wire transfer. Retainage shall not apply, and Buyer shall not
          hold back any retainage from Seller, even if retainage is part of any
          contract between Buyer and any other party. Payment is not contingent
          on Buyer's ability to collect or obtain funds from any other party.
          Buyer consents to Seller's presentment of and request for payment of
          any check or other payment order issued to Seller by Buyer by any
          commercially reasonable electronic means in accordance with applicable
          provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, and Buyer further authorizes
          any bank or other financial institution on which any such order is
          drawn or through which such order is payable to make payment pursuant
          to such order directly to Seller or for credit to Seller's account by
          electronic funds transfer. If Buyer fails to make any payment to
          Seller when due, Buyer's entire account(s) with Seller shall become
          immediately due and payable and Seller may suspend further performance
          under any order with Buyer. Seller may repossess and remove any
          materials sold to Buyer where payment is outstanding, without notice
          or demand. Notwithstanding anything stated therein to the contrary,
          any lien waiver or release executed by Seller related to the goods
          sold under these Terms shall only be effective to the extent payment
          is received, paid by the drawee bank, and not avoidable as a
          bankruptcy preference. Seller may apply Buyer's payment against any
          open charges within Seller's sole discretion. Seller may exercise
          setoff or recoupment to apply to or satisfy Buyer's outstanding debt.
          Buyer shall have no right of setoff hereunder, the same being
          expressly waived hereby. Buyer agrees to pay Seller on past due
          accounts a monthly interest charge equal to the maximum interest
          charge permitted to be charged by the law governing the account
          between Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller further agree that, where
          required by law to specify such rate, a rate of one and one-half
          percent (1.5%) per month shall apply. The interest shall continue to
          accrue after Seller receives a judgment against Buyer at the highest
          rate allowable by law then in effect. At no time will interest be
          charged at a rate higher than the maximum rate allowable by law in the
          State where suit is brought. Buyer agrees to pay Seller all costs and
          expenses of collection, suit, arbitration or other legal action,
          including all actual attorneys and paralegal fees, incurred pre-suit,
          through trial, on appeal, or in any administrative proceedings,
          mediations or arbitrations brought as a result of the commercial
          relationship between them. In any jurisdiction where a stated rate is
          required, reasonable attorney's fees shall be 15% of the outstanding
          balance.

          to promptly pay to Seller all such funds. Upon request, Buyer shall

          <b>Credit Terms</b> Issuance of any credit by Seller to Buyer shall be
          subject to the approval of Seller's credit department in its sole
          discretion. If Seller determines in its sole discretion that Buyer's
          financial responsibility is unsatisfactory, or becomes impaired, or if
          Buyer fails to make any payment for any goods purchased from seller
          when due, then Seller may postpone or decline to make any shipments
          except upon receipt of satisfactory security or payment of cash in
          advance of shipment, or Seller may cancel any or all contracts with
          Buyer or any portion thereof. If Buyer fails to comply with these
          Terms, or Buyer's credit becomes unsatisfactory in Seller's sole
          discretion, Seller reserves the right to terminate or restrict
          Seller's credit on any order upon notice to Buyer. Buyer certifies
          that it is solvent and that it will immediately advise Seller if it
          becomes insolvent. Buyer agrees to send Seller written notice of any
          changes in the form of ownership of Buyer's business within five days
          of such changes.

          production, supply, transportation, or consumption of the goods being
          sold, or with the supply or consumption of any raw materials or labor
          used in connection with the goods. Upon occurrence of an Unavoidable
          Force, the time for Seller's performance shall be extended reasonably,
          the purchase price shall be adjusted for any increased costs to Seller
          resulting therefrom, and Buyer shall not be entitled to any other
          remedy.
